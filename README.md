Access by NFT Plugin
====================

Access by NFT Plugin allows users to define which Posts or Pages have limited access based on user's wallet contents (NFTs).

Ex. let's say you own Crypto Ducks Club NFTs and want your blog content to be available only to other Crypto Ducks Club owners - with this plugin, you can do that.

Requires [dashboard.accessbynft.com](https://dashboard.accessbynft.com/) account (API KEY).

Uses [api.accessbynft.com](https://api.accessbynft.com/) to do the actual verification (verifies cryptographic signatures and token ownership).

Supported wallets:
- [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.near.org/)
